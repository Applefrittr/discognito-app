# Discognito

Have you ever wondered what happens in your Discord channels after you log off? Why there always seems to be problems whenever you're not around? Well, Discognito is the solution you've been looking for! With it, you can stream live text chat's directly to the app while being completely logged out of Discord, anonymously!

Install the Discognito Bot into your server today and give yourself the power of anonymous surveillance!

## Purpose

Purely an educational project learning the in's and out's of working with Discord's API. This app will stream text channel input from all text channels that the bot has permission to view. Must be invited/installed into a Discord server. Once installed, the Discord server will show up in the UI with all associated text channels. Click a text channel to begin stream.

Note: The app does not retrieve text chat history, but rather streams any new messages posted in the selected text channel in real time, along with the user that posted the message.
